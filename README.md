# Effective TensorFlow

_We aim to gradually expand this series by adding new articles and keep the content up to date with the latest releases of TensorFlow API. If you have suggestions on how to improve this series or find the explanations ambiguous, feel free to create an issue, send patches, or reach out by email._

You can find the whole content in the `"interactive_README.ipynb"` notebook,
which you can view (statically) on github.

But you can also instantiate an interactive version of the `"interactive_README.ipynb"` notebook using Binder (click the badge):

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MTDzi/EffectiveTensorflow/master?filepath=interactive_README.ipynb)

or create a conda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
and run the `"interactive_README.ipynb"` notebook on your local machine.

 _We encourage you to also check out the accompanied neural network training framework built on top of tf.contrib.learn API. The [framework](https://github.com/vahidk/TensorflowFramework) can be downloaded separately:_
```
git clone https://github.com/vahidk/TensorflowFramework.git
```
